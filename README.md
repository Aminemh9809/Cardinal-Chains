#   Cardinal Chain (en version terminal)
"Cardinal Chains" is a minimalist puzzle game centering on the concept of non-decreasing sequences. Each puzzle begins with a monochrome grid of numbers, 
plus a few colored cells marked with an "x". Starting at these cells, you must link up numbers in non-decreasing order until the whole grid is filled with color. 
The puzzles are carefully designed by hand, each with a unique solution. Difficulties and types of puzzles are varied, and there is no timer, nor a limited number of tries.
